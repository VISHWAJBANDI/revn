        <summary>different b/w bold tag and strong tag in html</summary>
        <p>
            Both gives visual output same, but bold tag is a physical tag & strong tag is a logical tag. Basically when bold tag is used, it only makes the words thicker... But when strong tag is used, it makes the word thicker & also tells the Browser that the text inside "strong" tag is important.
